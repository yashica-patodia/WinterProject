# WinterProject -Web Scrapper

## Description

I implemented a multi-level scrapper  which extracts and scrapes data from this [page](http://www.commonlii.org/resources/221.html) .This uses beautiful soup for parsing the data.Same can also be implemented by using selenium.

## How To Use

### Installation

 #### Install beautiful soup

```html
    python -m  pip install bs4
```
 #### Install requests module

```html
   python -m pip install requests
```
 ### Os is python's standard library so no need to download it.
## How To Run 

### For extracting .pdf files run the 2020_pdf file in the console and press Enter.
   * It automatically downloads the pdf files.
### For extracting .txt files perform the following operations-:
  * Run the main.py file . This will first  create a urls.txt file and then start extracting  data from every link in it .
